# VibeVim

VibeVim is a little experiment on how well a project-level AI coding assistant (i.e., Vibe Coding) can generate and maintain a Neovim configuration that specializes in Vibe Coding.
Specifically, I will start with a simple `init.lua` containing the recommended installation for [avante.nvim](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim) and let it build its own configuration from there.
All project instructions, prompts, and other manual intervention (if any) will be documented here.

## Background

I have never been a fan of "vibe coding" tools, largely because I love tinkering and using Neovim and CLI tools.
But I am also aware of the prevalence of Vibe Coding tools in software engineering industry, and if it becomes the future, I would (a) be aware of what it is capable of and what's the best prompting techniques (b) rather use Neovim than a VS Code-based editor.
If you want my Neovim configuration without any AI tools and usage, check out my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/theopn/dotfiles).
